# Aorus B450 pro repair
I was in need of a pc upgrade so i spent a while looking for used motherboards on the local used market, specifically AM4 motherboards with the B450 chipset.
I came across a listing for a **Gigabyte Aorus B450** for 50 bucks so, out of curiosity as to why the price was so low, i clicked on it and checking out the description
i found out why:
> selling this motherboard because i was updating the bios and something went wrong, black screen on boot, someone could probably save it by flashing it or something like that idk how to do, i already switched to another motherboard.
"must be an easy fix" i told myself, unaware of the chaos to come, _so i bought it right away_.
I receive it the next week, and the next few are a waiting game for the other components to be delivered - now it's Thursday and i'm HYPED to get this thing working, so i assemble it and,,,
the system _partially_ works:
- RGB lights are on
- i get a POST beep without errors
- motherboard logo screen 
what doesn't work though...:
- any type of input
- the screen is literally frozen
